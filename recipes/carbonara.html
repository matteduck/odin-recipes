    <h2>At dinner this pasta dish is nice served alongside a plate of greens, but when you’re in the throes of an after-hours hang, just grab a fork.</h2>
    <p>With crispy bits of pork, a peppery bite, and a velvety cheese sauce enriched with eggs, carbonara is just as easy to make for dinner as it is at 2 a.m. after a long night out. It’s one of Rome’s signature dishes, and just like cacio e pepe and other pasta recipes in that class, its simplicity demands proper technique and quality ingredients. Cured meat adds a salty depth to the dish, and while guanciale is the most traditional choice, diced pancetta or bacon also work well. Egg yolks give the carbonara sauce its luscious texture and golden hue, so pick up farm-fresh eggs if you can. And when it comes to the cheese and pasta, this is the time to spend a little extra: Buy a wedge of Romano cheese or real Parmigiano Reggiano and a nice box of spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni.</p>

    <p>A word on technique: To achieve the creamy sauce’s signature sheen, adding the ingredients at just the right time and temperature is key for any carbonara recipe. Whisking a quarter cup of hot pasta water into the raw egg mixture and turning off the heat before adding it to the pasta helps bring everything together into a glossy, emulsified sauce without overcooking the yolks. From there, toss everything together quickly and add more pasta cooking water to thin the sauce as needed. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>4 servings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
        <li>4 oz. guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), pancetta (Italian bacon), or bacon</li>
        <li>2 oz. Parmesan or Pecorino Romano</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat <strong>6 qt. water</strong> in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add <strong>3 Tbsp. salt</strong> and cover pot with a lid (this will bring water to a boil faster).</li>
        <li>While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove <strong>4 oz. guanciale</strong> from packaging and cut into about 1x¼" strips. Finely grate <strong>2 oz. cheese</strong> and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.</li>
        <li>Whisk <strong>4 egg yolks</strong> and <strong>2 whole eggs</strong> in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining grated cheese. Add several cranks of <strong>pepper</strong> and set aside.</li>
        <li>Working next to pot, heat <strong>2 Tbsp. oil</strong> in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7–10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 3 Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.</li>
        <li>Cook <strong>1 lb. pasta</strong> in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes shy of package instructions. Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and water is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk ¼ cup reserved pasta water into egg mixture, then very slowly stream into Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if needed. Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won’t use all of it).</li>
        <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
    </ol>
